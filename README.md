Getting stuff done - more vapourware, this time with shiny new tech

## TL;DR
Playing around with shiny new tech by creating a web app for following the [Getting Things Done](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) organisational framework.

## What's this all about?
I want to play with a whole bunch of shiny(ish), new(ish) tech.  I intend to do this by building a vapourware web app to help follow the [Getting Things Done](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) organisational framework.
Tech I want to play with includes:
 * Cucumber
 * Property based testing
 * Clojure
 * Isomorphic web applications using Om Next
 * Continuous deployment
